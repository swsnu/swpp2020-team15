## 2 frontend + crawling(stock)
- [X] sign in / sign up
- [X] forget ID / password find (testing) (DAUN)
- [X] change password/nickname (testing) (DAUN)
- [X] redirection to prelogin/main page (WOO0)
- [X] logout (WOO0)
- [X] signout (WOO0)
- [X] comment (JUNHYEOK)
- [X] crawling for stocks

## 3 crawling(news) + ML
- [X] recently searched stocks + delete records (testing) (G1)
- [X] see price trends (WOO0, Junhyeok) - start Junhyeok
- [X] financial state G1
- [X] news of another date 
~~- [ ] news search(insight) (2) -DAUN~~
- [X] click news (3) 
- [ ] ML modeling (4) - Junhyeok
- [ ] **news in detail**

## Machine Learning 
- Reinforced learning
- simple NLP (node node)
- neural network (CNN, RNN, LSTM)
- genetic algorithms >> ?

## Progress check
### Goals
1. Visualization of graph
2. Machine learning
3. testing
4. front localstorage use - login status steady

#### DONEs
- [X] sign in sign up feature
- [X] forget ID / password find / change password / nickname feature
- [X] news of another date crawling
- [X] financial state crawling
- [X] comment backend
- [X] comment backend testing
- [X] stock state backend
- [X] stock state backend testing
- [X] logout feature
- [X] signout feature
- [X] searchbox feature (excpet recent history delete)
- [X] redirection prelogin/main page feature

#### HIGH-PRIORITY
- [X] stockhistory state backend - Junhyeok
- [X] ML modeling feature - Daun
- [X] graph visualization feature - Junhyeok
- [X] news search feature (G1)
- [X] sessionStorage feature - Woo0
- [X] presentation files

최종확인
- [X] comment feature (edit/delete visibility, post) (Woo0)
merge `comment, findpassword, logout, Crawler, recent-search`

pytorch >> backward propagation >> lots of examples >> MLP model

#### LOW-PRIORITY

- [X] financial state backend >> scoring-considering backend design?
