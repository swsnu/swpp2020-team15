## 2 frontend + crawling(stock)
- [X] sign in / sign up
- [ ] forget ID / password find (testing) (DAUN)
- [ ] change password/nickname (testing) (DAUN)
- [X] redirection to prelogin/main page (WOO0)
- [X] logout (WOO0)
- [X] signout (WOO0)
- [ ] comment (testing, almost finished) (JUNHYEOK)
- [X] crawling for stocks

## 3 crawling(news) + ML
- [X] recently searched stocks + delete records (testing) (G1)
- [ ] see price trends (WOO0, Junhyeok) - start Junhyeok
- [ ] financial state DAUN (1) -weekend 
- [ ] news of another date 
- [ ] news search(insight) (2) -DAUN
- [ ] click news (3) 
- [ ] ML modeling (4) - Junhyeok
- [ ] **news in detail**

## Machine Learning 
- Reinforced learning
- simple NLP (node node)
- neural network (CNN, RNN, LSTM)
- genetic algorithms >> ?

## Progress check
### Goals
1. Visualization of graph
2. Machine learning
3. testing
4. front localstorage use - login status steady

#### DONEs
- [X] sign in sign up feature
- [X] forget ID / password find / change password / nickname feature
- [X] news of another date crawling
- [X] financial state crawling
- [X] comment backend
- [X] comment backend testing
- [X] stock state backend
- [X] stock state backend testing
- [X] logout feature
- [X] signout feature
- [X] searchbox feature (excpet recent history delete)
- [X] redirection prelogin/main page feature

#### HIGH-PRIORITY
- [ ] stockhistory state backend - Junhyeok
- [ ] ML modeling feature - Daun
- [ ] graph visualization feature - Junhyeok
- [ ] news search feature (G1)
- [X] sessionStorage feature - Woo0
- [ ] presentation files

최종확인
- [ ] comment feature (edit/delete visibility, post) (Woo0)
merge `comment, findpassword, logout, Crawler, recent-search`

pytorch >> backward propagation >> lots of examples >> MLP model

#### LOW-PRIORITY

- [ ] financial state backend >> scoring-considering backend design? 

- [ ] logout testing
- [ ] sign in sign up reducer testing
- [ ] forget ID / password find / change password / nickname testing
- [ ] financial state testing
- [ ] news search testing
- [ ] searchbox testing
- [ ] redirection prelogin/main page testing
- [ ] front localstorage feature testing
- [ ] comment testing
- [ ] financial state backend testing
- [ ] stockhistory state backend testing
- [ ] ML model testing
- [ ] signout testing
- [ ] news of another date testing
- [ ] graph visulization testing
