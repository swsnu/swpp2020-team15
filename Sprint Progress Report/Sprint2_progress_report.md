# Sprint2 Progress Report

## Implementation of this Sprint
### Frontend
* **Header, Footer**<br />

* **Sign-in**<br />

* **Sign-up**<br />

### Backend
* **Model design** <br />
Before starting the backend development, the entire model to be used in the project was conceived and implemented, and the controller was formulated for how each model would be used.

* **

* **Crawler** <br />
The crawler is implemented to directly update the model data by crawling real-time prices of all stocks within 1 minute <br />
It can crawl as many stock information as it wants in the past of all stocks and store them directly in the model <br />



### Difficulties <br />
When team members developed their own part with their own thoughts and collaborated on parts with each other, development communication was difficult until the takeover took over.
In order to solve this problem, it was decided to unify the commit form, and after each development, they agreed to write a work report every day.
