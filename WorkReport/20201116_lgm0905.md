## Jobs (Write down what you have done)
**Commit : news, fs query optimize**
  - See https://github.com/swsnu/swpp2020-team15/issues/56
  
**Commit : End logout backend testing**
  - Add logout test & views/user.py coverage approach 100%
  
**Commit : Revise news, fs page**
  - Initially, news and financialstats page don't react from url change, but from date-picking, or tab-changing.
  - I fix this from giving `id` props, which is `stock_id` from url.
  - You can check this from <br/>
  https://github.com/swsnu/swpp2020-team15/commit/d424b81e05cbfe2dc471180cb4bfe60f27455e54
  - I am confused about this approach is best, so tell me when you have better approach.

## Problems (Write down problems you have experienced)
  - **I am little worried about this small query optimizing is applied in bigger data DB.**
  - Currently, MySQL's find(or SELEECT) query to primary key(id) is O(1)(hashing),
  - But When data grows, O(1) query from DB is OK, but next query in backend O(n).
  - 2 day news is about 20000(now), 30 days is 600,000(maybe final DB..?)
  - In fact, I'm not sure whether this will affect me or not. It may not be affected by processing approximately 100 million structures per second.
  - **If there's anything you want to say about this, I'd like you to tell me.**
