## Problems (Write down problems you have experienced)
  - There's some redundant request exists.
  - At the beggining, There were cases where they were added but were not rendered. I think this is a DB problem, but I'll check it out.
  
## Evils (Write down weird things that you have done so that everyone should be careful)
  - `useState` async problem
  - `useEffect` dep with `useSelector` testing

## Plans (Write down what are you going to do next)
1. put alert in need point
2. Deploy test (Since we're working in a local environment, I think we need to try it at this point.)
